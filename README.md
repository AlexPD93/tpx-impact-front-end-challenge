# TPX Impact Stopwatch
For this task you will create a HTML page with a functional stopwatch. The stopwatch must have the following features:

* Time display: The current elapsed time in the following format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds)
* Start button: A button to start or continue a timer.
* Pause button: A button to pause the running timer.
* Reset button: A button to reset the timer to zero.

## Bonus Points 

* Lap button: A button to write the time to a list/table of laps (this would not pause the timer). The results should be shown on screen and still be visible if the page is refreshed.
* Clear lap history button: A button to clear any lap history
* Make it look good
* No bugs or quirky behaviour... (is keeping good time?)
* Any build tools, instructions or other things you think a good project should include

## Improvements 

* Make the stopwatch do an actual lap time rather than displaying the time when lap is pressed.
